Evidence looks ok. Could you have produced only 1 .pdf? It would be better organized. 


2.

The distinction between a superkey and candidate key is deficient. Remember

3.

Perhaps the date/time fields could be nullable in the example provided. What if

4.

The ``access rows by content only'' rule explanation is wrong. Please check
your notes or the book Chapter 6.1.

The ``all rows must be unique'' rule is wrong. Please check your class notes or
Chapter 6.1 of the textbook.
