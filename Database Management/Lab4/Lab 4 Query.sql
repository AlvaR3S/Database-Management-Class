--8. Tell me about check constraints: 
--What are they? 
 --What are they good for? 
 --What is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? 
--Make up some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses check constraints. 
--Explain the differences in your examples and argue your case.   
Constraints are rules that specify how a table acts. They are great for setting restrictive definitions of a table when it is made. When a constraint is placed on a table it allows for others to clearly identify what they cannot and can input into the table. This also assists with information that is not supposed to be input into the table. By trying to input a value that does not hold up to this Constraint it will through an error message and explain to the user what went wrong. A good example of a constraint is a NOT NULL value when creating a value that states it is not null. A bad example of a constraint is using the PRIMARY KEY incorrectly. For example, if a person creates a table and uses a contraint with PRIMARY KEY and inputs the wrong attribute it can lead to multiple mistakes within the table. The difference between both examples is in the way they use them. When using constraints incorrectly this can lead to error. Never use constraints when they do not need to be used. Constraints can help define and specifythe created attributes.
