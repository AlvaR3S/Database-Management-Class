Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable


1. Show the cities of agents booking an order for a customer whose id is 
   'c002'. Use joins; no subqueries.

Incorrect output
- You are joining the wrong tables.


2. Show the ids of products ordered through any agent who makes at least 
   one order for a customer in Dallas, sorted by pid from highest to 
   lowest. Use joins; no subqueries.

Incorrect output
- You are joining the wrong tables.


5. Show the names of customers who placed at least one order through an 
   agent in their own city, along with those agent(sâ€™) names.

Incorrect output
- You are joining the wrong tables.
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.
Incorrect SQL statement
- You missed a semicolon!


6. Show the names of customers and agents living in the same city, along 
   with the name of the shared city, regardless of whether or not the 
   customer has ever placed an order with that agent.

Incorrect output
- You are giving an extra city; you only were asked to give the name (singular) 
  of the shared city.
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.


7. Show the name and city of customers who live in the city that makes the 
   fewest different kinds of products. (Hint: Use count and group by on 
   the Products table.)

Incorrect output
- This one could have been done without joins. 
- You did not test this query, why?
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.



In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- You submitted a text file, that was not runnable, I had to convert your
  file to the desired format. Please check the file I created lab5.sql
  Your file, in its current format produced lots of erros. 

- PLEASE only include your queries! You included a lot of other things. 

- Make sure you have semicolons at the end of each of your queries. 
  Your query produced an error!
